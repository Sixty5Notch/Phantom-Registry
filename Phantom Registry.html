<h2><br>What is a Persona, Anyway?</h2>

<p style="font-size:160%;">A Persona, at least in the context of Persona 5 is the physical manifestation of the character's rebellious spirit or side. In the real world, these Personas only exist inside of the characters minds. However, if they enter the Metaverse which is a world of the human mind, they can summon these rebelious spirits or Personas as powers to help them.

  <h6 style="font-size:160%;">Overpowered Personas</h6>
  <li>Izanagi No Okami-Piccario</li>
  <p>-This Persona has an ability called "Myriad Truths" which does heavy Almighty damage to all enemies 3 times. For context, 
  Almighty attacks are attacks that no enemy can is immune to. As if that wasn't enough raw power he has what they call a "Trait" that means that the more Personas you have registered
  the more damage this Maniac will do. On top of all of that, he has a move called Victory Cry which means at the end of every fight if you have him equipped all your SP (The games energy resource) 
  will be restored. So he can do the most damage in the game by a long shot, it attacks all enemies, no enemy is immune to his attack and he gives you all your energy back at the end of the fight.
  Pretty absurd.</p>
  <td><img src="Images/Personas/Izanagi.webp" width = "344" height = "400" align="center"></td>
  <li>Alice</li>
  <p>-Alice is on this list because of her signature move named "Die For Me" which is a guarenteed insta-kill to all enemies except those who are immune to curse, as well as her "Trait" that makes it to where this move costs no energy. I put 
  her below Izanagi because certain enemies and all the boss fights in the game won't let you use insta-kill on them which means shes really only effective with dispersing common enemies, but despite this fact she is still absurdly powerful
  and one of the most saught after Personas in the franchise.</p>
  <td><img src="Images/Personas/Alice.webp" width = "233" height = "400" align="center"></td>
  <li>Shiki-Ouji</li>
  <p>-Shiki-Ouji while not absurdly powerful in the grand scheme of Persona 5, is insane for the time you get him, the main reason being the fact that he reflects physical. Reflecting Physical is insanely powerful considering how physical attacks are the most common form of attacks
  in Persona and some of the strongest, being able to have physical attacks Return To Sender at the low level 18 is honestly quite absurd. Not only this but he also has pretty solid skills, with the best being Oni Kagura which does Medium Physical damage to all foes with a chance of 
  inflicting rage.</p>
